# Wildcards
An extension version of a script from https://github.com/jtkelm2/stable-diffusion-webui-1/blob/main/scripts/wildcards.py

Allows you to use `__name__` syntax in your prompt to get a random line from a file named `name.txt` in the wildcards directory.

## Install
To install, clone the repo to your `extensions` directory, and then restart the web ui.

From your base `stable-diffusion-webui` directory, run the following command to install:
```
git clone https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui-wildcards extensions/stable-diffusion-webui-wildcards
```
